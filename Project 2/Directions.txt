Make sure you create a folder in Github so I can see the progress over time.  I am to be a collaborator so I can check your progress.  You are to create a folder inside of this repository called Project 2.  In the folder you will place the work you have done with respect to Project 2 up to this point and/or if you haven't started you will place Project 1 which will be modified to become Project 2.  I will keep track of your progress over the coming weeks.

Refer, to the Project 1 writeup and examples of previous students submissions. Also, send me an email attaching the writeup and the program to mark.lehr@rcc.edu with the subject LastName,FirstName - Project 2 - 48983

Make sure to include concepts for Chapters 9 to 16.  To make sure you don't exclude anything provide a checklist of those concepts that should be included vs. what you actually included.
