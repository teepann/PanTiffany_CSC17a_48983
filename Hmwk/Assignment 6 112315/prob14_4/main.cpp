 * Assignment: Problem 14.4 NumDays Class
 * Directions: Design a class called NumDays . The classâ€™s purpose is to store a value that represents a
number of work hours and convert it to a number of days. For example, 8 hours would
be converted to 1 day, 12 hours would be converted to 1.5 days, and 18 hours would
be converted to 2.25 days. The class should have a constructor that accepts a number
of hours, as well as member functions for storing and retrieving the hours and days.
The class should also have the following overloaded operators: +, -, ++, --

    n1 = --n2;
    cout << n1.getNumDays();
    return 0;
