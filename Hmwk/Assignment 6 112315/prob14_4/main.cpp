 * Assignment: Problem 14.4 NumDays Class
 * Directions: Design a class called NumDays . The class’s purpose is to store a value that represents a
number of work hours and convert it to a number of days. For example, 8 hours would
be converted to 1 day, 12 hours would be converted to 1.5 days, and 18 hours would
be converted to 2.25 days. The class should have a constructor that accepts a number
of hours, as well as member functions for storing and retrieving the hours and days.
The class should also have the following overloaded operators:
 * + Addition operator. When two NumDays objects are added together, the overloaded
+ operator should return the sum of the two objects’ hours members.
− Subtraction operator. When one NumDays object is subtracted from another,
the overloaded − operator should return the difference of the two objects’ hours
members.
++ Prefix and postfix increment operators. These operators should increment the
number of hours stored in the object. When incremented, the number of days
should be automatically recalculated.
−− Prefix and postfix decrement operators. These operators should decrement the
number of hours stored in the object. When decremented, the number of days
should be automatically recalculated.
