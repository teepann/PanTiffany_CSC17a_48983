 * Assignment: Problem 14.1 Numbers Class
 * Directions: Design a class Numbers that can be used to translate the whole dollar
 * amounts in the range 0-9999 into an English description of the number. For example,
 * the number 713 would be translated into the string seven hundred thirteen. The class
 * should have a single integer member variable: int number;
 * and a static array of string objects that specify how to tranlate key dollar amounts
 * into the desired format. ie, you might use static strings such as:
 * string lessThan20[20] = {"zero", "one",..., "nineteen"};
 * string hundred = "hundred";
 * string thousand = "thousand";
 * The class should have a constructor that accepts a nonnegative integer and uses it to
initialize the Numbers object. It should have a member function print() that prints
the English description of the Numbers object. Demonstrate the class by writing a main
program that asks the user to enter a number in the proper range and then prints out
its English description.
