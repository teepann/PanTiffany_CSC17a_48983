Calculate the mean, median and mode and an additional 3 problems from Chapter 9.

Flowchart the mode function.

Given a repeated set array such as {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,etc...} of a chosen length, output the mean, median mode, max frequency and number of modes for the set.

Utilize dynamic array allocation to size the modal array.

Create 3 functions

float mean(int [],int),
float median(int [],int),
int *mode(int [],int)

where the array returned from the mode is {number of modes, max frequency, mode1, mode2, .... , modeN} sized as 
number of modes + 2
