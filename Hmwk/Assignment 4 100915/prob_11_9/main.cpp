 * Assignment: Problem 11.9
 * Directions: Write a program that keeps track of a speakers’ bureau. The 
 * program should use a structure to store the following data about a speaker:
 * Name
 * Telephone Number
 * Speaking Topic
 * Fee Required 
 * The program should use an array of at least 10 structures. It should let the 
 * user enter data into the array, change the contents of any element, and 
 * display all the data stored in the array. The program should have a menu-driven 
 * user interface. Input Validation: When the data for a new speaker is entered, 
 * be sure the user enters data for all the fields. No negative amounts should 
 * be entered for a speaker’s fee.
