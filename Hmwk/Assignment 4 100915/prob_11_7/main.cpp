 * Assignment: Problem 11.7 Customer Accounts
 * Directions: Write a program that uses a structure to store the following data 
 * about a customer account: Name, 
 * Address, 
 * City, State, and ZIP
 * Telephone Number
 * Account Balance
 * Date of Last Payment
 * The program should use an array of at least 10 structures. It should let the 
 * user enter data into the array, change the contents of any element, and 
 * display all the data stored in the array. The program should have a 
 * menu-driven user interface. Input Validation: When the data for a new account 
 * is entered, be sure the user enters data for all the fields. No negative 
 * account balances should be entered.
