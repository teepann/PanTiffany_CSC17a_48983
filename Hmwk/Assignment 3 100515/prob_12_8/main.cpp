 * Date: October 1, 2015
 * Assignment: Problem 12.8
 * Directions: write a function named arrayToFile. The function should accept 3 
 * arguments: the name of afile, a pointer to an int array,
 * the size of the array. the function should open the specified
 * file in binary mode, write the contents of the array to the file,
 * and then close the file.
 * write another function named file ToArray. This function should accept
 * 3 arguments: the name of a file, a pointer to an int array, the size of array.
 * the function should open the specified file in binary mode, read its contents
 * into the array, and then close the file.
 * write a complete program that demonstrates these functions by using the 
 * arrayToFile function to write an array to a file, and then using the 
 * fileToArray function to read the data from the same file.
 * After the data are read from the file into the array, display
 * the array's contents on the screen.
