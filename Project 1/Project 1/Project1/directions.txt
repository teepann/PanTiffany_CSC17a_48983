The game starts with 1 or 2 randomly placed numbers in a 4x4 grid (16 cells).
Use the controls to move the cells. ( Press W/A/S/D )
2 cells of the same number will merge and add up.
New 2s and 4s will appear randomly on an empty cell with each move you make.
Your objective is to make 2048 in a cell without getting stuck!
